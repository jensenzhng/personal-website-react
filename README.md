# My Personal Site

<img src="./demo.png"/>

This project is a port of my pure HTML/JS/CSS site to ReactJS. I wrote this while learning React, so the code may not be following every single React convention - I'm still learning React so I'll make sure to update my code accordingly :P 

## Tech Stack
- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/)
- CSS3

## Want to run the site locally?
- Clone this repository to your device
    - `git clone https://github.com/jensenzhng/personal-website-react.git`
- Install dependencies in root folder
    - `npm i`
- Run project
    - `npm run start`

## Future
This site's always a work in progress, I'm always looking to add cool stuff to it :)
- [x] Rework tech stack part of page
- [ ] Contact me part of page
- [ ] Add more projects to portfolio
- [ ] Spotify section with my favorite songs :)

## Special thanks ❤️
